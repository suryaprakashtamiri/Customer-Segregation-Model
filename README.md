# Customer-Segregation-Model
A customer segmentation project using clustering techniques could involve collecting data on customer demographics, purchasing habits, and other relevant factors, and using this data to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics.

To begin the project, you would need to preprocess and clean the data, selecting relevant features and possibly scaling or transforming the data to make it more suitable for clustering. You could then use a clustering algorithm, such as k-means or DBSCAN, to group the customers into clusters based on their similarities.

#Approach
##1. Data Pre processing
Standard scaling and LabelEncoder
##2. Dimensionality Reduction
###PCA

REduction to 3 Principal components
##3. Optimal Clusters

##6. Insights
There are many potential insights that could be gained from a customer segmentation project using clustering techniques. Some examples include:

Identifying distinct market segments: By grouping customers into clusters based on their characteristics, you can identify distinct market segments and understand the common traits of each group. This can be useful for developing targeted marketing campaigns and tailoring products and services to the needs of specific segments.

Understanding customer behavior: By analyzing the characteristics of each cluster, you can gain insight into the behavior and preferences of the customers in each group. This can help you understand what drives their purchasing decisions and how to effectively engage with them.

Identifying trends and patterns: By tracking the results of marketing campaigns and other customer interactions, you can identify trends and patterns within each cluster. This can help you understand which marketing approaches are most effective for different segments and how to optimize your engagement with each group.

Improving customer retention: By identifying the specific needs and preferences of each cluster, you can develop targeted campaigns and offers that are more likely to be relevant and appealing to the customers in each group. This can help you improve customer retention and build stronger relationships with your customers.

Increasing customer lifetime value: By understanding the characteristics and behavior of each customer segment, you can identify opportunities to upsell and cross-sell products and services that are likely to be of value to them. This can help you increase the lifetime value of your customers and grow your business.
